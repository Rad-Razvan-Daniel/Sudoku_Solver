# Sudoku_Solver
This project is made entirely in c++.
I use SFML for the visual elements. 
All the code was made by me, dating the start of my GitHub activity. 

The solving algorithm I used is backtracking. I also plan on implementing Stochastic search.
Right now I am working on making the game actually playable, but every time I commit, the application should be usable.

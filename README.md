# Sudoku_Solver
This project is made entirely in c++.
I use SFML for rendering, some of the event handling and manipulating textures and sprites. 
All the code was made by me, dating the start of my GitHub activity. 

Algorithms used: Backtracking, and I plan on implementing Stochastic search.
Right now it's incomplete but I plan on making a user interface and generating the sudoku while playing.
